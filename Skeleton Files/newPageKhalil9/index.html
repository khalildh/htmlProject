  		<h2 class="h2"> Welcome to Let's Travel The World! </h2>

  		<p>By traveling - both within the USA and abroad - we expand our horizons and gain a greater appreciation of the world we live in.</p>

 	 	  <p>Experiencing other cultures, including new food, languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us better understand our own culture.</p>

  		<p>We are a full service travel agency. As seasoned travelers ourselves, we know what we're talking about and can draw upon our own experiences when putting together a great adventure for you and your family.</p>

  		<p class="Nope">Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips ahead! Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get out the color pushpins...</p>

  		<p class="Nope">So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</p>
