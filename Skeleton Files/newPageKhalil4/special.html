  		<h2 class="h2"> This Month's Special: Washington DC</h2>

  		<p class="pspecial">Starting from $699, we have three-day trips available to our nation's capital. Price includes coach airfare, hotel shuttle, and two nights in a three-star hotel.</p>

 	 	  <p class="pspecial">Don't miss this opportunity to see all the sites Washington DC has to offer: The White House, Capitol Building, Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Washinton Monument, Library of Congress, and so much more!</p>

  		<p class="pspecial">In fact, it could take days just to see what the Smithsonian Institution has to offer. Not only are there 19 different museums and galleries, but also the National Zoo. It's the world's largest museum and nearly everything (including the zoo) is completely free!</p>


      <!--
  		<p class="Nope">Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips ahead! Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get out the color pushpins...</p>

  		<p class="Nope">So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</p>
